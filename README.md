# BCS-Portfolio-2
This assignment's goal was to create a web page to be mobile friendly using media queries and implementing bootstrap.

For the Index, a navbar was used from bootstrap and adjusted so that when used on mobile, the screen would adjust accordingly to fit the size of the mobile device.

For the Portfolio, the entire content section along with the images are are centered and placed on top of each other while using a mobile device.

Finaly for the Contact page, most of the techniques used in the prior pages were used in this one except for a new form bootstrap.
